# FormFactoryTest and Asp.net Core 2.2

Sample of NestedFormsExample2. I also added my own form under Models/Create. Just head over to Index. Nested inputs are readonly, don't send data and dragging multilists produce an error in Console. Resources were missing until I added prettify script in _layoutpartial.

FormFactory itself is available at https://github.com/mcintyre321/FormFactory/
