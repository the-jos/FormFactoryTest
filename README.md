# FormFactoryTest and Asp.net Core 2.2

Sample of NestedFormsExample2. I also added my own form under Models/Create. Just head over to Index. Nested inputs are readonly, don't send data and dragging multilists produce an error in Console. Resources also seem to be missing.

FormFactory itself is available at https://github.com/mcintyre321/FormFactory/
